"""
Interactive tool to do the following:

Look at the instrument and order stack
Put in a fill for an existing order that wasn't picked up from IB


FIX ME FUTURE:

- check IB for fills (would also happen automatically)
- cancel an order on the stack
- manual trade: create an instrument and contract trades, put on the stack for IB to execute
- balance trade: create an instrument and contract trades and fill them immediately with a manual fill to match an older IB order
